1. Smart Device Hierarchy
Concepts: Inheritance + Encapsulation + Constructor Chaining

Problem:

Create a class SmartDevice with private fields brand and price.
Create a class Smartphone extending SmartDevice, adding cameraMP and batteryLife.
Create another class Smartwatch extending SmartDevice, adding strapMaterial and isWaterResistant.
Use constructors, proper encapsulation, and a method to display full device info.

Challenge: Create an array of SmartDevice references and store both Smartphone and Smartwatch objects,
           then use polymorphism to print device info.
