2. Game Character Inheritance
Concepts: Inheritance + Method Overriding + Encapsulation
Problem:

Create a base class GameCharacter with name, health, and level.
Create subclasses Warrior, Mage, and Archer, each with a different attack method.
Use overriding to implement different attack() behavior in each subclass.

Challenge: Write a method battle(GameCharacter enemy) which displays the type of attack used based on object type.
