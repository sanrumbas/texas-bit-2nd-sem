5. Car Racing Game Classes

Concepts: Inheritance + Polymorphism + Encapsulation

Problem:
Create a class Car with private fields model, maxSpeed, and a method drive().
Create subclasses SportsCar and Truck, overriding drive() with different print messages.

Add special features like boost() in SportsCar and loadCapacity in Truck.

Challenge: Use an array of Car objects to simulate a race where each vehicle announces its type and action.
